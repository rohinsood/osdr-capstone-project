Study Title	Artificial gravity partially protects space-induced neurological deficits in Drosophila melanogaster (Immunohistochemistry)
Study Description	Spaceflight poses risks to the central nervous system (CNS), and understanding neurological responses is important for future missions. We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to spaceflight microgravity (SFμg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight. This study derives results from the immunohistochemistry (cellular and molecular imaging) assay from whole brains.

Study Protocol Description	F1 generation flies returned live were dissected (R+0 and R+25) and brains were immediately fixed for 20 minutes in PBS (Phosphate buffered saline) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 6.7% sucrose, and 0.01% tween-20, and stored at 4°C in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide.	Stained brains were imaged using Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope in the histology and microscopy core facility at the Gladstone Institute, University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Image dimensions were 1028x1028 and slides per image varied based on thickness of sample.	4-8 fly brains were mounted on a slide and separated by a spacer.	F1 generation flies returned live were dissected (R+0 and R+25) and brains were immediately fixed for 20 minutes in PBS (Phosphate buffered saline) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 6.7% sucrose, and 0.01% tween-20, and stored at 4°C in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide. The R+0 and R+25 brains were stained for immunohistochemical analysis where staining for different antibody markers was conducted at the same time to facilitate comparison and reduce variability. The brains were stained following a standard protocol.	Briefly, the fixed brains were washed with PBS and PBT (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min each, incubated with blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum (Catalog   566380, Sigma) in PBT) for one hour, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. One set of brains (labeled Set 2) were stained with anti-elav (1:100, Catalog   7E8A10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), host species - rat) to label all the neurons, anti-cc3 (1:100, Catalog   9661, Cell signaling Technology, host species - rabbit) as apoptotic marker, and anti-8-oxo-dG (1:100, Catalog   4354-MC-050, RandD systems, host species - mouse) as the DNA oxidative damage marker. Another set of brains (labeled Set 1) were stained with anti-Repo (1:50, Catalog   8D12, DSHB), University of Iowa, host species - mouse) to label the glia, and anti-TH (1:300, Catalog   AB152, EMD Millipore, host species - rabbit) to label the dopaminergic neurons. These preparations were then washed three times with PBT for 10 min each, and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-mouse (1:200; Catalog   A-11031, Invitrogen), Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:200; Catalog   A-11034, Invitrogen), or Alexa fluor 633 goat anti-rat (1:200; Catalog   A21094, Invitrogen). Final washes were performed once with PBT and twice with PBS, each for 10 min, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, H-1000) for imaging.	The w1118 wildtype line (Bloomington Stock Center) was used in this study. Thirty hours prior to launch, one-day-old virgin male (10) and female (25) fruit flies were loaded into the adult food cylinder 3 in each of the six MVP modules (F0 generation). The food cylinder was then immediately opened to adult fly chamber 2. The modules were then placed inside of a standard cargo transfer bag for launch. Prepared food cylinders were stored at 4°C for the duration of launch and ISS operations. Approximately 3.7 days (90 h) after launch, the payload was delivered to the ISS and the crew installed a food cylinder 2 inside the MVP module and opened the food cylinder 2 to adult fly chamber 2 (Mission day equals 5), giving flies access to the new food. Food cylinder 3 was closed at this time. This procedure was repeated for all MVP modules, and the modules were loaded into the previously installed MVP habitat hardware by the ISS crew. At this time, the six SF1g modules started spinning at 68 rpm to maintain 1g in spaceflight while the six SFμg modules were maintained at microgravity levels. After 5.5 days of egg laying (Mission Day equals 10), food cylinder 2 was opened to adult fly chamber 1 to allow the eggs laid in space to develop and emerge into adult flies in chamber 1. At the same time food cylinder 2 was closed to adult fly chamber 2, such that the launch populations of flies were prevented from entering food cylinder 2, thus keeping the generations separated. Food cylinder 3 was reopened to adult fly chamber 2 to continue providing food to this population for the remainder of the experiment. The larvae and flies that emerged from the food cylinder 2 into the adult fly chamber 1 had undergone their entire developmental life cycle during spaceflight (F1 generation). At this time, food cylinder 1 was inserted and opened to chamber 1 to allow egg laying in cylinder 1, which will produce the second generation of spaceflight-developed flies (F2 generation). Food cylinder 2 remained open to chamber 1 during egg lay to allow adults to continue emerging. This also allowed us to know the age range of the adult flies returned for postflight experiments (∼11-17-day adults). The MVP locker was powered down after the experiment. All the science operations, including food cylinder changes and fixation and opening/closing of chambers, were performed by the ISS crew. Unforeseen weather conditions delayed the mission by 4 days, during which the crew repowered the MVP hardware on mission day 31 and powered it off on mission day 34 for return to Earth. The total duration of spaceflight exposure for the samples in this study was approximately 29 days, as the egg laying period began on day 1 (April 6 2018, 14:50 UTC) and the Dragon capsule undock took place on day 29 (May 5 2018, 13:22 UTC). Ground control samples were asynchronous, and went from May 31, 2018 0:10 UTC to June 28 2018 22:52 UTC.	To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.
